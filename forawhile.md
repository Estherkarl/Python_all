# Task 1 - reverse word
Your task is to write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it, using a for loop.

Hint: the range() function accepts negative numbers!

Your results should look like this:
Input a word to reverse: hello
Reversed word: olleh


# Task 2 - count digits and letters
Your task is to write a Python program using for loop, that counts digits and letters.
User should be prompted to enter her/his characters with the keyboard, even without looking at it.
Store the information about number of digits and letters in some variables.

Hint: use one of the string's method and try to type only letters and digits!

Your results could look like this:
Input your characters: dgbudf8gsdf7g8sd7fg7dsf7g7y7df7ygsdfg775uybgfbfdug8fdsugdfsguf7g7df7g7ydf7yg7rye7gy7eryg
Number of digits:  21
Number of letters:  67 


# Task 3 - Upper and lower letters
Your task is to write a Python program using while loop, that iterates over given string and converts the lower letters to capital letters and vice versa.
Print it out after changes.

Hint: use string's methods and be careful of long texts and new lines!

Note: You can use any text, for example from lyrics. My was:
"Overhead the albatross Hangs motionless upon the air And deep beneath the rolling waves In labyrinths of coral caves" ðŸ˜ƒ

Your results should look like this:

oVERHEAD THE ALBATROSS hANGS MOTIONLESS UPON THE AIR aND DEEP BENEATH THE ROLLING WAVES iN LABYRINTHS OF CORAL CAVES


# Task 4 - find divisible numbers
Your task is to write a Python program using while loop, read (prompt) three numbers (a,b,c) and check how many numbers between a and b are divisible by c.
Input 0 (zero) as a third number (divisor) finishes program and prints out the results.

Your results should look like this:
Type starting integer: 1
Type ending integer: 100
Type divisor: 15


15  is divisible by 15
30  is divisible by 15
45  is divisible by 15
60  is divisible by 15
75  is divisible by 15
90  is divisible by 15


Type starting integer: 5
Type ending integer: 8
Type divisor: 0
